                <div class="info-item">The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is not to be confused with the <a

                        Terrier</a>. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier, also known as a &quot;Stafford&quot; or
                    &quot;Staffie&quot;.</div>
                <div class="info-item">The Staffordshire Bull Terrier originated around the 19th century in the region
                    of Staffordshire, England.</div>
                <div class="info-item">Although they excelled in the fighting ring, known for being ferocious and
                    courageous, they still made excellent family pets, adoring especially the children.</div>
                <div class="info-item">The Staffordshire Bull Terriers are intelligent, tough, courageous, tenacious and
                    persistent. Totally fearless and curious, they're liable to jump off of a deck or walk through
                    broken glass. They are energetic and enthusiastic in everything they do be it play, work or love.
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">Staffordshire Bull Terriers are medium sized and pack a lot of power in their
                    muscular bodies. They have strong jaws and prominent cheek muscles and are smooth-coated dog in
                    variety of different colors.</div>
                <div class="info-item">They are also known for their loyalty, affection, obedience, off-duty quietness,
                    trustworthy stability and their love for people. It has been said that &quot;No breed is more loving
                    with its family&quot;.</div>
                <div class="info-item">Staffies has a cheerful appearance and a positive outlook on life. These dogs
                    also possess a fair amount of self-confidence and are very playful and can be rather animated in
                    their enthusiasm. Owners of these dogs often describe them as active and goofy, always wanting to be
                    in the centre of attention.</div>
                <div class="info-item">The dog's tolerance and patience with children has earned it the nickname
                    &quot;The Nanny Dog&quot;.</div>
                <div class="info-item">Despite a fierce appearance, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a lover, not a
                    fighter. It is gentle, docile, easy to care for and always seeking fun.</div>
                <div class="info-item">Because Staffyâ€™s are so attentive and interested in people they will always alert
                    you to the presence of visitors, wanted or unwanted. They are very aware of their surroundings and
                    nothing goes unnoticed and being a very loyal dog, they will stand by their owners and protect them
                    with whatever force is needed. However they are generally not barkers, but they are definitely
                    vocal. This breed will entertain you with his snorts, snores, grunts, and groans, as well as his
                    singing voice, often described as a yodel.</div>

                        Bushveld</a> is a true story by South African author Sir Percy Fitzpatrick. The book tells of
                    Fitzpatrick's travels with his dog, Jock, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, during the 1880s, when he
                    worked as a storeman, prospector's assistant, journalist and ox-wagon transport-rider in the
                    Bushveld region of the Transvaal (then the South African Republic).</div>

            <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;A dog has no use for fancy cars or big homes or designer clothes. Status symbol means nothing
                    to him. A waterlogged stick will do just fine. A dog judges others not by their color or creed or
                    class but by who they are inside. A dog doesn't care if you are rich or poor, educated or
                    illiterate, clever or dull. Give him your heart and he will give you his&quot;</p>
